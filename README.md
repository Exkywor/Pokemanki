# Pokémanki

Pokémanki is an add-on that keeps you motivated to keep doing Anki by allowing you to catch and train Pokémon!
Pokémanki gives you a Pokémon (or an egg which will hatch into a Pokémon) for each lowest-level deck (deck without subdecks) in your collection that you have started learning.
As you learn and review the cards in that deck, your Pokémon will level up and may even evolve!

Your Pokémon can be accessed by viewing your Stats, where they will be above the rest of your boring charts and figures.
Here you can see either the Pokémon for the specific deck or for the whole collection by clicking "deck" or "collection" at the top of the Stats screen.

The settings can be accessed under "Tools".
